\chapter{Conclusions}

The discovery of the Higgs boson was the highlight of the physics results of Run I at the LHC. In addition to measuring the properties and couplings of the Higgs, efforts were launched to use the Higgs as a probe for new physics, including to search for dark matter. In parallel with these studies, progress was made by complementary, non-collider searches. Although no direct detection has been confirmed, large areas of parameter space have been excluded. Collider searches, including the search for the mono-Higgs signature, have much better sensitivity to low-mass DM than direct searches, as well as the ability to study higher order couplings that are not accessible to direct searches. The main results of this thesis are the rediscovery of the Higgs boson with Run II data and the cross section limits on two DM models, contributing to the world-leading low-mass limits and mediator mass exclusions for these models.

The impact of this study is very high, being among the first ever searches for the mono-Higgs signature. Several key contributions were made to the SM Higgs search in the four lepton final state, including a cross-check exercise to validate the event selection with other groups, and the definition of a new event category for Higgs candidate events with large missing transverse momentum. The key ingredient that this study added to the SM search and collaboration documentation is the study of $\MET$. In particular, whether the background and statistical modeling techniques remain valid in the high $\MET$ regime. 

There are numerous extensions of this analysis that would have a large impact on the field. The limits found with the four-lepton final state can be combined with the results from the other Higgs decay channel analyses to obtain even stronger results. This work is underway. There are additional models that predict a mono-Higgs signature that can be studied with the datasets currently available. The most commonly studied models are those that predict very hard $\MET$ spectra, which gives an advantage to other Higgs decay channels. Many of the unstudied models with softer spectra would favor the four lepton channel. Finally, a more detailed study can be done to understand the relationship of the limits found here with those set by other search strategies in order to guide the design of future analyses and experiments. 

There is strong motivation for a coupling between the dark sector and ordinary matter. Studies such as this one shed light on the nature of this interaction. With technology and analysis techniques constantly advancing, it is only a matter of time before DM is observed, expanding our understanding of the mass-energy content of the universe beyond the mere 5\% that we currently know.
